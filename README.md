# Natural Language Coaching Assistant

Run the file ‘main.py’
Type ‘coach message’ and press ENTER for coaching message
After getting the coaching message, have conversation with Gemini about the response you receive
NOTE: the texts exchanged between user and Gemini are saved in the database called ‘database.db’. If you want to restart the conversation, for any reason, delete that file and use the commented out lines before the ‘main’ function to generate the Fitbit details again into the database. That line should be commented out after creation.
